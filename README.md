# hello! thank you for stopping by ^_^

## introduction
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @esby-space!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in space exploration, computer science, physics, math, languages, and learning in general!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning too many things. There's not enough time...
- ðŸš€ I like to dream big, come dream with me!!

## about me
i'm 17 years old and a high school student! i started learning how to code, seriously anyway, about march of 2021.

github is much confusing, sorry if i did wrong things

## active projects (that may or may not be abandoned tomorrow)
- 14413 Trinity Phoenixes!
  - Building out a website
  - 2022 FTC Competition
- Summer of Math Exposition 2, I got no idea what I'm doing
- Esby Explorations, my personal site with interactive fun things

## trying to learn...
- Rust programming for game development and simulations
- Machine Learning with Python Tensorflow
- Callibration of sensors for plant spectroscopy
- A discord bot for personal and club use

## previous projects (not abandoned, not complete, just on hold >_>)
- Protein Modeling resources and troubleshooting guide (that itself needs some troubleshooting)
- really bad simulations that don't work whatsoever
- Pixi Panda, making games with PixiJS
